autoreact TODOs
---------------

	- [ ] Performance tests
	- [ ] ??? Prevent UIState objects from being passed to components
	- [ ] SHOULD WORK BETTER WITH FLUX:
		- [ ] 		A single store keeps app state.
		- [ ] 		A single UIState keeps UI state.
		- [ ] 		Store updates UIState
	- [ ] Bind a UIState value with an input field
	- [ ] Should the store perhaps grab a mutable copy of UIState?
		- [ ] 		Pro: clarity.
		- [ ] 		Con: prevents easy prototoyping without a store.
		- [ ] 		Pro: can seemingly explain the magic a bit?
